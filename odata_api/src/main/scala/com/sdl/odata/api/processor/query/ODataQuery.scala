 *
 * It is equivalent to the following JPQL query: `SELECT x FROM LeftSource l JOIN l.joinPropertyName r`
 * where `x` is either the left side or right side (`l` or `r`).
 *
 * This form of join is what the OData framework needs to do when in the URL there is a `PropertyPath` element that
 * refers to a navigation property. For example:
 *
 * http://myserver/odata.svc/ConfigurationItems('xyz')/Values

 *     "Values",
 *     JoinSelectRight
 *   )

 *
 * SELECT e2 FROM ConfigurationItems e1 JOIN e1.Values e2 WHERE e1.ID = 'xyz'
 * 
 * @param leftSource The left source.
 * @param rightSource The right source.
 * @param joinPropertyName The name of a navigation property in the left source that refers to entities in the right source.
